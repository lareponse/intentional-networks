# **Intentional Networks for Specification Building**

*AI-Mediated Consensus through Graphed Conversation*

---

## Abstract

Requirements engineering remains one of the hardest problems in software and organizational development. Misalignment between stakeholders, delayed conflict discovery, and static documentation frequently derail projects.

We propose **Intentional Networks**: a new paradigm where specifications emerge from **AI-mediated graphed conversations**. Stakeholders express intentions in plain language; AI agents structure them, detect conflicts, propose syntheses, and generate executable acceptance criteria. The result is a **living specification** — continuously updated, traceable, and requiring no technical expertise from participants.

This paper presents the conceptual foundation, system architecture, illustrative examples, and potential applications of Intentional Networks, and argues for their transformative potential in software engineering, governance, and collective decision-making.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem of Specifications

Projects fail not because people lack ideas, but because intentions are lost in translation. Traditional requirement documents:

* Demand technical vocabulary foreign to many stakeholders.
* Conceal contradictions until development or testing.
* Freeze into outdated artifacts as soon as change occurs.

The result is the familiar “requirements gap” — what was asked, what was written, what was built, and what was actually needed often diverge.

### 1.2 The Opportunity of AI Mediation

Advances in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **graph-structured knowledge representations** allow us to capture not only what is said, but also the *why*, *how it relates to others*, and *what tensions exist*.

We can transform conversation into computation.

## 2. Concept: Intentional Networks

### 2.1 Definition

An **Intentional Network** is a graph of human intentions, constraints, and rationales, structured and mediated by AI agents.

* **Nodes**: intentions (goals, constraints, contexts, rationales).
* **Edges**: relationships (support, conflict, refinement, transclusion).
* **Flows**: conversations evolve into living specifications, which evolve into tests, which evolve into systems.

### 2.2 Key Properties

* **Transclusion**: each intention retains its origin, history, and conclusion intact.
* **Conflict as data**: contradictions are explicit and trigger synthesis prompts.
* **Livingness**: the graph evolves as conversations continue, with AI curating changes.
* **Executability**: acceptance criteria and tests are derived automatically.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Flow

```
Stakeholder Intentions (plain language)
          ↓
    AI Structuring (NLP/LLM)
          ↓
  Intentional Graph (nodes + edges)
          ↓
 Conflict Detection + Synthesis
          ↓
 Living Specification (aligned design space)
          ↓
  Acceptance Criteria + Executable Tests
```

### 3.2 Components

1. **Capture Layer** — NLP agents convert raw stakeholder text into structured intentions.
2. **Graph Store** — intentions stored as graph nodes with semantic edges.
3. **Conflict Detector** — identifies tensions (e.g. performance vs simplicity).
4. **Synthesizer** — proposes design challenges, compromise options, and branching solutions.
5. **Test Generator** — produces acceptance criteria in Gherkin or equivalent.
6. **Execution Engine** — runs generated tests in CI/CD.

## 4. Illustrative Example

### 4.1 Raw Intentions

* User: “I just want to find yesterday’s file fast.”
* Developer: “System must handle 100k docs.”
* UX Designer: “Interface must stay simple.”

### 4.2 Graph Representation

* Node A: *fast retrieval*
* Node B: *system performance*
* Node C: *interface simplicity*
* Edge A↔C: conflict: *simplicity vs powerful features*

### 4.3 AI Synthesis

Design Challenge: *How might we provide powerful search while keeping the UI clean?*
Solutions proposed: progressive disclosure, contextual suggestions, smart defaults.

### 4.4 Generated Acceptance Test

```gherkin
Scenario: Quick search for recent documents
  Given I created "report.pdf" yesterday
  And the system contains 100k documents
  When I search for "report"
  Then I see "report.pdf" in the top 3 results
  And the search completes in under 2 seconds
  And the UI shows ≤ 3 filters by default
```

## 5. Comparison with Traditional Methods

| Dimension         | Traditional Specs           | Intentional Networks                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Language          | Technical jargon            | Natural language                    |
| Conflict Handling | Detected late, costly       | Detected early, explicit            |
| Traceability      | Weak, version-based         | Strong, graph-based with provenance |
| Adaptability      | Static documents            | Living, evolving graph              |
| Executability     | Manual translation to tests | Auto-generated tests                |

## 6. Related Work

* **Requirements Engineering (RE)** — long-standing field focused on eliciting, modeling, and validating requirements. Intentional Networks extend RE by embedding conflict synthesis and test generation.
* **Agile/BDD/ATDD** — frameworks where specifications double as tests. IN generalizes this by starting at the *intention level*, prior to user stories.
* **Knowledge Graphs** — provide the representational substrate for Intentional Networks.
* **Collaborative Decision-Making Systems** — civic tech and policy platforms attempt similar goals but lack direct executability.

## 7. Implementation Strategy

### 7.1 Prototype Phases

1. **MVP**:

   * Web app for intention capture.
   * AI converts to structured graph + detects conflicts.
   * Export to Gherkin tests.

2. **Pilot**:

   * Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
   * Support live stakeholder updates.

3. **Scaling**:

   * Multi-domain support: software, policy, organizational design.
   * Integration with decision-logs, Slack/Teams, civic platforms.

### 7.2 Technical Stack

* NLP/LLM: intent parsing (OpenAI, Llama 3.2, custom fine-tuning).
* Graph DB: Neo4j, RDF triple store.
* Orchestration: containerized microservices.
* Test frameworks: Cucumber, Playwright.

## 8. Evaluation Framework

Metrics for validating Intentional Networks:

* **Alignment**: % of stakeholder intentions reflected in generated tests.
* **Conflict resolution**: # of tensions detected and synthesized before implementation.
* **Cycle time**: reduction in time from conversation → executable test.
* **Coverage**: breadth of stakeholder perspectives captured.
* **Adoption**: usability by non-technical participants.

---

## 9. Potential Applications

* **Software Engineering** — turn planning meetings into tests.
* **Policy Formation** — structured deliberation into traceable rules.
* **Organizational Strategy** — intentions become living decision graphs.
* **Civic Platforms** — citizen input structured into executable commitments.

---

## 10. Vision

Intentional Networks position AI as mediator, archivist, and executor of human collaboration.

At scale:

* Conflicts aren’t failures, they’re design constraints.
* Agreement isn’t forced, it’s synthesized.
* Specifications stop being static documents; they become **living networks of intention**.

This is not merely a new tool for software. It is a **new substrate for collective intelligence**.

## Conclusion

By replacing linear requirement documents with AI-mediated intentional graphs, we enable **true agreement** across diverse stakeholders without technical literacy. Intentions are preserved, conflicts synthesized, and outputs executable.

**Intentional Networks close the loop: from conversation → consensus → code.**
